# Movement-Artifact-Direction-Estimation
Empirically captured single-frame image set for benchmarking movement (motion blur) artifact direction estimation and weighted magnitude quantification. Each image contains a single dark circular object translated during exposure over a white background, producing controllable linear blur governed by (orientation pair, velocity).
